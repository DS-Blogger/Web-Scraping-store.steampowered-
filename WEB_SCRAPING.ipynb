    "##1 It is to note here that why does this code work here.. or why are we not usinh 'first=True'. It is because both developer and publisher uses same div, i.e. \"dev_row\". For learning purpose I used 'id'- to extract data out of developer.But in case of publisher there was no ID. We already know that 'html.find' creates a list, and that is why we uses 'first=True'. In dis case we did not want first data ([0]), we wanted second place ([1]). So we disabled 'first=True' and fetched data at [1] index. Try the following code for better understanding b=s.get(\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/911430/Good_Company/\") print(b.html.find('div.dev_row a')[1].text)"
